## What is DevChat?

The way developers chat and work with AI.

:speech_balloon: Write prompts, _not_ code.

## Why DevChat?

- To let AI write code, DevChat helps you bring **the right context** to AI.
  
  Chat history. Code. Files. A directory tree. `git diff --cached` or the output of any command.

- To apply AI-generated code, DevChat facilitate your **actions to take**.

  Show diff. Copy or insert. Commit & sync or export to docs, wiki, etc.
  
- To drive AI to work, define **your own workflows** with DevChat.
  
  Prompt templates. Iterative calls to AI. Program operations.

- To meet your personality, customize **your own experiences** with DevChat.
  
  Open source. No wait on opaque feature schedule. GPT-4 today and more models tomorrow.
  
## What is Prompt-Centric Software Development (PSSD)?

- Write prompts to create code. Turn prompts to everything.

- DevPromptOps
